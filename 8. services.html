<!--AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service.
    There are othe services like $timeout,$interval 
    

-->
<p>This example uses the built-in $location service to get the absolute url of the page.</p>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $location) {
    $scope.myUrl = $location.absUrl();
});

//Why we use it as we alredy have window.location for same, Angular JS provides the wrapper around this , provide more
//functionality and error handling always recommended to use inbuild services
