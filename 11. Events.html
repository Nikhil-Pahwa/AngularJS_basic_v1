<!--AngularJS has its own HTML events directives.
You can add AngularJS event listeners to your HTML elements by using one or more of these directives:

ng-blur
ng-change
ng-click
ng-copy
ng-cut
ng-dblclick
ng-focus
ng-keydown
ng-keypress
ng-keyup
ng-mousedown
ng-mouseenter
ng-mouseleave
ng-mousemove
ng-mouseover
ng-mouseup
ng-paste
The event directives allows us to run AngularJS functions at certain user events.

An AngularJS event will not overwrite an HTML event, both events will be executed.

<button ng-click="add()">Click Me!</button>

<p>{{ count }}</p>

var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.count = 0;
    $scope.add = function(){
        $scope.count += 1;
    }
    
});
